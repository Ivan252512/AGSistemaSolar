Description: # VPython
        
        This package enables one to run VPython in a browser, using the GlowScript
        VPython API, documented in the Help at https://glowscript.org. If the code is
        in a cell in a Jupyter notebook, the 3D scene appears in the Jupyter notebook.
        If the code is launched outside a notebook (e.g. from the command line), a
        browser window will open displaying the scene.
        
        VPython makes it unusually easy to create navigable real-time 3D animations.
        The one-line program "sphere()" produces a 3D sphere with appropriate lighting
        and with the camera positioned so that the scene fills the view. It also
        activates mouse interactions to zoom and rotate the camera view. This
        implementation of VPython was begun by John Coady in May 2014. Ruth Chabay,
        Matt Craig, and Bruce Sherwood are assisting in its further development.
        
        ## Installation
        
        For more detailed instructions on how to install vpython, see https://vpython.org, where you will also find a link to the VPython forum, which is a good place to report issues and to request assistance.
        
        Briefly:
        
        + If you use the [anaconda python distribution](https://www.continuum.io/anaconda-overview), install like this: `conda install -c vpython vpython`
        + If you use any other python distribution, install this way: `pip install vpython`
        
        ## Sample program
        
        Here is a simple example:
        
        ```python
        from vpython import *
        sphere()
        ```
        
        This will create a canvas containing a 3D sphere, with mouse and touch
        controls available to zoom and rotate the camera:
        
            Right button drag or Ctrl-drag to rotate "camera" to view scene.
            To zoom, drag with middle button or Alt/Option depressed, or use scroll wheel.
                 On a two-button mouse, middle is left + right.
            Shift-drag to pan left/right and up/down.
            Touch screen: pinch/extend to zoom, swipe or two-finger rotate.
        
        Currently, to re-run a VPython program in a Jupyter notebook you need to click the circular arrow icon to "restart the kernel" and then click the red-highlighted button, then click in the first cell, then click the run icon. Alternatively, if you insert "scene = canvas()" at the start of your program, you can rerun the program without restarting the kernel.
